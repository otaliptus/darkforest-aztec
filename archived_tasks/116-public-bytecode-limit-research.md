# Ticket 116 - Public bytecode limit research

## Goal
Research the Aztec public bytecode size limit and identify likely causes and low-impact mitigations for the "Input buffer exceeds maximum size" deployment error.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cite official sources explaining that public bytecode is published/packed as part of contract classes.
- Summarize likely cause(s) for hitting the limit in DarkForest.
- Provide low-impact mitigation options that preserve gameplay.
- No code changes required.

## Notes
- This is a research/report task only.
