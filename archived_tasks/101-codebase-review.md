# Ticket 101 - Repo-wide code review and improvement notes

## Goal
Provide a structured review of the repo with prioritized findings (bugs/risks/test gaps) and concrete improvement suggestions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Review covers core code under `packages/contracts`, `apps/client`, `packages/shared`, and `scripts` (excluding `node_modules` and `reference`).
- Findings are ordered by severity and include file/line references.
- Note test/coverage gaps and assumptions.
- Provide concise improvement suggestions without changing code.
