# Ticket 095 - Reduce planet highlight outline size

## Goal
Make the yellow highlight/outline around planets smaller so it hugs the planet instead of extending too far.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Yellow planet outlines are visually tighter and no longer appear oversized.
- Highlight still clearly indicates the planet being targeted/selected.
- No changes to game logic or rendering pipelines beyond sizing/styling.

## Out of Scope
- Color palette changes.
- New highlight effects or animations.

## Deliverables
- Adjusted outline sizing for planet highlights.

## Tests / Commands
- Manual: inspect planet hover/selection outlines in client UI.

## Status
- Backlog
