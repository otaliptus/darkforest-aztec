TASK 013 - Utility batch getters for arrivals and planet data

Mission:
Reduce RPC fan-out by providing batch getters in the contract.

Background:
Client currently issues many `read` calls in parallel (e.g., touched planet IDs, revealed coords, arrival lists). This can overload the node.

Scope:
Contract change + client update.

Plan:
1) Add `#[external("utility")]` batch getters, e.g.:
   - `get_planet_arrivals_batch(location_ids: [Field; N])`
   - `get_revealed_coords_batch(location_ids: [Field; N])`
2) Keep batch sizes fixed and small to avoid large calldata or public bytecode limits.
3) Update client to use batch endpoints when syncing.

Acceptance criteria:
- Sync flows replace many single reads with a few batch reads.
- Batch size is bounded and safe.

Risks / side-effects:
- Adds public interface surface. Must be kept stable.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Measure total RPC count before/after sync.
