Title: Implement global pause state

Context
- The contract has no global pause flag; `getIsPaused()` returns `false` in `apps/client/src/Backend/GameLogic/ContractsAPI.ts`.
- The only pause-related state in contract is per-planet `planet_pausers` (Titan ship effect).

Acceptance Criteria
- Add a global pause flag in contract storage.
- Implement pause/unpause with private validate -> public apply (only_self) flow.
- Enforce pause checks in relevant public apply paths (v0.6 parity).
- Update client to read pause state from contract (no hardcoded `false`).
- Tests cover pause and unpause behavior.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- Any new pause-related UI beyond wiring existing paused state view.

Notes
- This overlaps with admin functions; confirm access-control approach.
