TASK 018 - Arrival count tracking in storage

Mission:
Avoid scanning all 12 arrival slots when fewer are populated.

Background:
`planet_arrivals` is fixed-length (12). We always iterate all slots. Storing a count could allow early stopping in some loops.

Scope:
Contract storage layout change + migration.

Plan:
1) Extend `PlanetArrivals` to include `count`.
2) Update insert/remove logic to maintain count.
3) Update iteration logic to stop after `count` (still guard against 0s).
4) Provide migration strategy for existing storage.

Acceptance criteria:
- All arrival insert/remove logic maintains `count` correctly.
- Iteration logic uses `count` without breaking semantics.

Risks / side-effects:
- Storage layout change requires migration and test coverage.
- Small performance gain relative to MiMC costs.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Add tests for insert/remove edge cases.
