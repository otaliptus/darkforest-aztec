TASK 051 - Ensure Aztec client deploys account on first use
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
When a player creates/imports an Aztec account in the browser, ensure the
account contract is deployed on-chain before sending game transactions.

Scope:
- Client only (Aztec connection flow).

Plan:
1) Add an account deployment helper in the Aztec client connect flow.
2) Use Sponsored FPC (if available) for the deployment fee.
3) Skip deploy if the account already exists on-chain.

Acceptance criteria:
- Fresh browser accounts are deployed on-chain before init_player is called.
- If account already exists, the client skips deployment.
- Errors surface with a clear log message.
