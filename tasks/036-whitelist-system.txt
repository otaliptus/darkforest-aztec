Title: Implement whitelist system (v0.6 parity or Aztec-native equivalent)

Context
- Whitelist / key proof flow is missing in `packages/contracts/src/main.nr`.
- Client still contains whitelist UI and helpers (`apps/client/src/Frontend/Pages/GameLandingPage.tsx`, `apps/client/src/Backend/Utils/WhitelistSnarkArgsHelper.ts`).

Acceptance Criteria
- Implement whitelist logic that matches v0.6 behavior (key usage, admin key management) or an explicitly approved Aztec-native equivalent.
- Private validate -> public apply (only_self) flow for whitelist usage.
- Clear access control for whitelist admin operations.
- Client whitelist flow works end-to-end.
- Tests cover allowlist, key usage, and admin actions.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New onboarding flows beyond v0.6 whitelist behavior.
- UI redesign beyond enabling existing whitelist UI.
