TASK 007 - Piggyback arrival resolution on moves/upgrades

Mission:
Reduce explicit resolve txs by relying on side-effect resolution in existing actions.

Background:
`apply_move` already calls `process_pending_arrivals` for from/to planets. Similar behavior exists for upgrades. We can skip explicit resolve calls when a relevant action is pending.

Scope:
Client-side logic update (optionally add notes in contract docs).

Plan:
1) When a move or upgrade is queued to a planet, mark that planet as "arrival-resolve-covered" for the pending tx.
2) Skip submitting `resolve_arrival` for that planet while the action tx is in flight.
3) If the action fails, re-queue resolution.

Acceptance criteria:
- Explicit resolve tx count drops in busy gameplay.
- Arrivals still resolve when the move/upgrade lands.

Risks / side-effects:
- If action tx fails or is dropped, arrivals might delay; ensure retry logic exists.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Create an arrival and issue a move to the same planet; verify arrivals resolve after the move without explicit resolve.
