TASK 061 - VITE env overrides for client config
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Ensure VITE_* env vars override the webpack defaults so Cloudflare builds use
VITE_AZTEC_NODE_URL (and other VITE_* overrides) instead of localhost defaults.

Scope:
- apps/client/webpack.config.js

Plan:
1) When a VITE_* env var is present, also set the base key in CLIENT_ENV if the
   base env var is not explicitly set.

Acceptance criteria:
- Setting VITE_AZTEC_NODE_URL in Cloudflare results in AZTEC_NODE_URL being set
  in the client bundle to the devnet URL.
- Defaults still apply when neither AZTEC_NODE_URL nor VITE_AZTEC_NODE_URL is set.
