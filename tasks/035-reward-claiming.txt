Title: Implement end-of-round reward claiming (v0.6 parity)

Context
- `claimReward` is missing in `packages/contracts/src/main.nr`.
- Player reward fields (`score`, `finalRank`, `claimedReward`) are absent in `packages/contracts/src/types.nr`.
- Client has a reward flow that expects on-chain support (`apps/client/src/Backend/GameLogic/GameManager.ts`).

Acceptance Criteria
- Add reward-related fields to `Player` with v0.6 parity (score, finalRank, claimedReward).
- Implement `claimReward` with private validate -> public apply (only_self) flow.
- Add `TOKEN_MINT_END_TIMESTAMP`/round-end configuration as required by v0.6 rewards.
- Wire client reward flow to on-chain state.
- Tests cover reward claiming and failure cases.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New reward schemes beyond v0.6.
- UI redesign beyond enabling existing reward flow.
