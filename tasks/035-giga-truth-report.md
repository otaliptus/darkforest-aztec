# Ticket 035 - Giga truth report (state of repo)

## Goal
Provide a fact-based report of what is implemented, what is missing, what is misleading, and how the current Aztec port differs from Dark Forest v0.6.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Summarize implemented contract + client capabilities based on code and tests.
- Call out missing or stubbed features and UI/UX gaps.
- Identify misleading/outdated docs or flows that do not match Aztec reality.
- List concrete diffs vs Dark Forest v0.6 (logic and UX).
- Explicitly ignore task/plan claims; base conclusions on code, tests, and runtime configs.

## Out of Scope
- No code changes.

## Deliverables
- Report in assistant response.
