Title: Add planet createdAt timestamp (v0.6 parity)

Context
- `Planet` has `last_updated` but no `createdAt` in `packages/contracts/src/types.nr`.

Acceptance Criteria
- Add `createdAt` to `Planet` state with v0.6 parity.
- Set `createdAt` on first initialization and keep it unchanged thereafter.
- Wire client types/state to surface `createdAt` if used.
- Tests cover initialization and immutability of `createdAt`.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- Any gameplay changes beyond adding the timestamp.
