# Ticket 036 - UI/UX parity checklist

## Goal
Provide a pane-by-pane UI/UX compatibility and playability checklist for the Aztec client, marking what works, what's missing, and what's misleading.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Enumerate major pages/panes/components in the client UI.
- For each, mark status: works / partial / missing / misleading.
- Tie each status to concrete code references.
- Focus on Aztec mode behavior (not Ethereum-only flows).

## Out of Scope
- No code changes.

## Deliverables
- Checklist in assistant response.
