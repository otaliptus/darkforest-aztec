TASK 022 - Assert arrival ID removal

Mission:
Add a defensive assertion to ensure arrival IDs are removed from the planet list.

Background:
`execute_arrival` iterates and clears the arrival ID from `planet_arrivals` but does not assert that it was found. Silent failure leaves stale IDs and can block future arrivals.

Scope:
Contract change.

Plan:
1) Track a `removed` flag when clearing the ID.
2) After the loop, assert `removed == true`.
3) Provide a clear error message.

Acceptance criteria:
- If the ID is missing from the list, the function reverts.
- Normal resolution paths still succeed.

Risks / side-effects:
- Any inconsistent on-chain state will now hard-fail (intended).

Testing / benchmarks:
- Add a test that attempts to resolve an arrival with a missing ID and verify revert.
