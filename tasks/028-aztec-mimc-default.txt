TASK 028 - Aztec MiMC default across stack

Mission:
Make Aztec MiMC (91 rounds, exponent 7) the default hashing path everywhere (contracts, client, hashing libs), removing mismatches with original Dark Forest MiMC.

Background:
We previously introduced Aztec MiMC implementations and a feature flag in contracts, but the build script overwrites the flag file and client/worker still use the original MiMC. This creates a universe mismatch and breaks mining/proofs. We now accept a new universe and want Aztec MiMC everywhere by default.

Scope:
Contracts + df-hashing library + client usage + tests.

Plan:
1) Fix feature flag generation to always define USE_AZTEC_MIMC = true (or provide a clear, consistent default).
2) Ensure contract hash_2/hash_3_4 always use Aztec MiMC by default.
3) Update df-hashing to default to Aztec MiMC for location IDs and perlin rand hashes (perlinRandHash).
4) Update client/miner imports/usages to use Aztec MiMC where they currently use mimcHash.
5) Adjust any test vectors or comments that assume v0.6 MiMC.

Acceptance criteria:
- Contract hashing uses Aztec MiMC by default and is not overwritten to undefined values by build scripts.
- Client/miner hashing uses Aztec MiMC by default and matches contract outputs.
- Perlin rand hashes use Aztec MiMC by default (consistent with contract).
- No mismatched universe between client and contract.

Risks / side-effects:
- New universe: location IDs, perlin values, artifact IDs change.
- Requires redeploy + client rebuild.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Re-run contract tests.
- Basic client smoke: miner hashes align with contract location IDs for a known coordinate (optional scripted check).
