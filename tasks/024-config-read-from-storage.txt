TASK 024 - Read config from storage in private functions

Mission:
Eliminate client-supplied config data in proofs and use on-chain config directly.

Background:
Passing full config arrays into private functions is large and enables potential mismatches. Loading from storage is safer and reduces input size.

Scope:
Contract change + client update.

Plan:
1) Add a private helper `load_config()` to read config values from storage.
2) Replace config parameters in `init_player`, `reveal_location`, `move`, and `move_known` with storage-loaded values.
3) Update client calls to remove config inputs.

Acceptance criteria:
- Private functions no longer accept full config arrays.
- Config values used in proofs match on-chain storage.

Risks / side-effects:
- Adds private storage reads; ensure proving cost is acceptable.
- Requires client updates and possibly ABI changes.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Add tests to confirm correct behavior with config pulled from storage.
