TASK 016 - Batch multiple actions in a single tx (research)

Mission:
Explore batching actions (e.g., prospect + find) to reduce per-tx proof overhead.

Background:
Multiple actions in sequence can require multiple proofs/txs. Batching could reduce overhead but may exceed grant scope.

Scope:
Research + design proposal. Implementation only if within grant constraints.

Plan:
1) Identify candidate action pairs with clear ordering (prospect -> find, upgrade -> move, etc.).
2) Check Aztec private->public flow constraints for batching.
3) Draft a minimal API proposal if feasible.

Acceptance criteria:
- A clear go/no-go decision with technical rationale.
- If feasible, a minimal contract+client design sketch.

Risks / side-effects:
- May be out of grant scope and could introduce complex state transitions.

Testing / benchmarks:
- If implemented, measure tx count and proving time savings.
