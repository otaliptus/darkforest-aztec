Title: Draft grant update post (status + plan)

Context
- Need a detailed forum post summarizing current progress vs v0.6 requirements.
- Must call out what is done, what remains, and key risks (esp. proving speed).

Acceptance Criteria
- Draft a comprehensive grant update post that aligns with the original RFPG requirements.
- Include: completed items, in-progress, missing parity items, performance measurements, risks/negatives, and next steps.
- Keep it grounded in repo evidence (docs + code), no speculative claims.

Out of Scope
- Code changes beyond documentation.
