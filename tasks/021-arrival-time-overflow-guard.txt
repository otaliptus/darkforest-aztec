TASK 021 - Arrival time overflow guard

Mission:
Prevent `arrival_block` from overflowing u32 during long-distance moves.

Background:
`arrival_block` is cast to `u32`. Large `dist_max` can overflow and cause near-instant arrival.

Scope:
Contract change.

Plan:
1) Compute `arrival_block` as a larger type.
2) Add a guard that rejects moves where `arrival_block` exceeds `u32::MAX`.
3) Provide a clear error message.

Acceptance criteria:
- Overflow cannot occur; moves that would overflow revert.
- Normal moves are unaffected.

Risks / side-effects:
- Extremely large `dist_max` moves will be rejected (this is intended).

Testing / benchmarks:
- Add a test that attempts a huge `dist_max` and verify revert.
