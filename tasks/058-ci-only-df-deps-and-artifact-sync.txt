TASK 058 - CI-only df-deps prepare + auto artifact sync
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Make Cloudflare builds succeed without manual artifact copying and avoid extra
workspace prepares on local builds.

Scope:
- apps/client/package.json
- apps/client/scripts/ci_prepare_df_deps.js
- packages/contracts/package.json
- packages/contracts/scripts/sync_artifacts.js

Plan:
1) Gate the df workspace prepare step to CI-only in the client prebuild/dev/start.
2) Add a contracts sync script that copies the DarkForest artifact after compile.

Acceptance criteria:
- Local client builds no longer auto-run the df workspace prepare step unless CI is set.
- Cloudflare builds still run df workspace prepares (CI or CF_PAGES).
- Contract compile auto-syncs the DarkForest artifact into a tracked file.
