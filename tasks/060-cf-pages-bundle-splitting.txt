TASK 060 - Cloudflare Pages bundle size limit
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Ensure Cloudflare Pages build output respects the 25 MiB per-file limit by
splitting the client bundle and disabling production source maps.

Scope:
- apps/client/webpack.config.js

Plan:
1) Add webpack splitChunks + runtimeChunk with a maxSize below 25 MiB.
2) Disable production source maps to avoid oversized .map assets.

Acceptance criteria:
- No emitted JS asset exceeds 25 MiB in production build.
- Cloudflare Pages asset validation passes.
