# Ticket 001 - Repo analysis + grant plan

## Goal
Produce a repository inventory and an end-to-end implementation plan for the Dark Forest v0.6 port to Aztec.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Summarize each curated repo (`reference/darkforest-v0.6`, `reference/darkforest-local`, `reference/aztec-starter`, `reference/noir`) with purpose and key components relevant to porting.
- Map Dark Forest v0.6 circuits/contracts/client components to Aztec equivalents at a high level.
- Provide a full-feature implementation plan that includes tests and the performance target.
- Include explicit verification steps for each phase.
- Call out any mismatch between the expected repo map (packages/contracts, apps/client, packages/shared) and the current layout.

## Out of Scope
- No code changes beyond documentation/planning.

## Deliverables
- Plan + validation checklist in assistant response.

## Status
- Archived (2026-01-08).
