TASK 046 - Deduplicate field_to_signed usage in move/move_known
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Reduce constraint-heavy sign checks by computing signed coordinates once in move paths.

Background:
Both move and move_known currently call field_abs_u128 (which calls field_to_signed)
and then call field_to_signed again for diffs. This duplicates bn254 comparisons.

Scope:
Contract change only in packages/contracts/src/main.nr (move + move_known).

Plan:
1) Compute signed x/y for both endpoints once.
2) Use signed magnitudes for abs checks.
3) Use signed values for diff_x/diff_y.

Acceptance criteria:
- move and move_known produce identical behavior for valid/invalid inputs.
- No public interface changes.
- Noir contract tests pass.

Risks / side-effects:
- Any missed reuse could change behavior; verify abs bounds and diff checks remain intact.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Run Noir contract tests (yarn contracts:test:nr).
