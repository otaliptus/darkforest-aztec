TASK 008 - Client inflight tracking + proving buffer
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Prevent duplicate resolve submissions and reduce wasted proofs during long proving times.

Background:
The client often attempts `resolve_arrival` as soon as an arrival matures, but proving can take multiple blocks. This causes duplicate submissions.

Scope:
Client-only change in `apps/client`.

Plan:
1) Track inflight resolve txs by `arrivalId` and `toPlanet`.
2) Before submitting, check inflight maps and skip if already pending.
3) Add a buffer: only attempt resolve at `arrival_block + PROVING_BUFFER`.
4) Clear inflight entries on success or final failure.

Acceptance criteria:
- Duplicate resolve txs for the same arrival do not occur.
- Resolution is delayed by a small buffer (e.g., 2 blocks) to account for proving.

Risks / side-effects:
- Small UX delay is intentional; make it visible in logs or UI.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Simulate long proof time; verify only one resolve attempt is made.
