Title: Implement hats / cosmetics (v0.6 parity)

Context
- `buyHat` is missing in `packages/contracts/src/main.nr`.
- `hatLevel` is absent from `Planet` in `packages/contracts/src/types.nr`.
- Client hat UI exists (`apps/client/src/Frontend/Panes/HatPane.tsx`) but has no contract support.

Acceptance Criteria
- Add `hatLevel` to planet state (and any related storage/indexing).
- Implement `buyHat` with private validate -> public apply (only_self) flow in the Noir contract.
- Match v0.6 semantics for cost/upgrade behavior.
- Wire client to use the contract method and update local planet state accordingly.
- Tests cover hat purchase/upgrade and invalid cases.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New cosmetic types beyond v0.6 hats.
- UI redesign beyond enabling existing hat pane.
