Title: Remove all admin-only gameplay and contract paths

Context
- User request: “nuke all admin stuff in the contract and tests and gameplay.”
- Goal is to remove admin-only actions and exposure, not to change core gameplay logic.

Acceptance Criteria
- Contracts: admin-only actions (action types 6–9) are removed or hard-disabled; no public/private paths allow admin behavior.
- Feature flags: any admin action flags are removed or forced off; no scripts re-enable them.
- Client/gameplay: any admin UI or client-side flows are removed or hidden; no admin RPC usage remains.
- Tests: admin-only tests are removed or updated so the test suite does not depend on admin actions.
- Build/test: relevant tests run and pass (or known unrelated failures are clearly identified).

Out of Scope
- Non-admin gameplay changes.
- Changes to grant scope or parity decisions.

Notes
- Keep changes minimal and avoid touching .md files.
