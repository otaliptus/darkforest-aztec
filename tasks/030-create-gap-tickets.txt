Title: Create per-feature tasks for v0.6 gap checklist

Context
- User request: “Go with tasks” after producing a v0.6 → Aztec gap checklist.
- Goal is to add a task file for each missing feature so we can work one ticket at a time.

Acceptance Criteria
- Create a task file for each missing v0.6 feature listed in `docs/v06-aztec-gap-checklist.md`.
- Each task includes: Context, Acceptance Criteria, Out of Scope, Notes, and points to relevant contract/client files.
- No gameplay logic changes; tasks only.

Out of Scope
- Implementing any of the missing features.
- Changing existing contract/client behavior beyond tasks.
