TASK 005 - Resolve-by-planet API
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Replace per-arrival resolution with a planet-scoped resolution method.

Background:
Resolving by arrival ID can be done out of order and causes client complexity. A planet-level resolver is more aligned with the 12-slot arrival list.

Scope:
Contract change + client update.

Plan:
1) Add a public `apply_resolve_planet(location_id, up_to_block)` entry point (only self).
2) Private wrapper to enqueue the public call.
3) In public apply, loop arrivals and resolve any with `arrival_time <= up_to_block`.
4) Update client to call this instead of `resolve_arrival(id)`.

Acceptance criteria:
- Resolvers do not require an arrival ID.
- All matured arrivals for the planet are resolved up to the block cap.
- Existing per-arrival resolution still works (optional, but useful for fallback).

Risks / side-effects:
- New API surface; must be used carefully to avoid reentrancy style issues.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Resolve a mix of matured and non-matured arrivals and verify only matured are applied.
