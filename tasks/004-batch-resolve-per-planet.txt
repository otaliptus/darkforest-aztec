TASK 004 - Batch resolve per planet
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Resolve multiple arrivals for the same planet with a single proof.

Background:
The contract already has `process_pending_arrivals(location_id, current_block)` which resolves up to 12 arrivals. The client currently resolves arrivals one-by-one.

Scope:
Contract change + client update.

Plan:
1) Add a private entry point `resolve_planet_arrivals(location_id)`.
2) Inside it, enqueue a public `apply_resolve_planet(location_id)` that calls `process_pending_arrivals`.
3) Update client to use the new API when multiple arrivals are due for the same planet.

Acceptance criteria:
- One proof resolves up to 12 arrivals on a planet.
- Public function is `#[only_self]` and uses `current_block`.
- Client falls back to per-arrival resolution if needed.

Risks / side-effects:
- A planet with many arrivals still needs multiple calls (limit 12). That is fine.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Simulate 3+ arrivals to the same planet and resolve in one tx.
- Compare total number of txs vs per-arrival resolution.
