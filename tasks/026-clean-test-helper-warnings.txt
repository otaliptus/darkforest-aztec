TASK 026 - Clean unused helper warnings in Noir tests

Mission:
Eliminate compiler warnings from unused helper functions in `packages/contracts/src/test/darkforest_stub.nr` without changing test behavior.

Scope:
Only test helpers in darkforest_stub.nr. No contract logic changes.

Acceptance criteria:
- Remove or use helper functions that trigger unused warnings in `darkforest_stub.nr`.
- `yarn workspace @darkforest-aztec/contracts test:nr` runs without unused helper warnings from this file.
- Test behavior remains unchanged.

Notes:
- Prefer removing dead helpers rather than adding dummy calls.
