Title: Enforce token mint period (v0.6 parity)

Context
- Contract config lacks a token mint end timestamp.
- Client currently treats mint as unbounded (`TOKEN_MINT_END_SECONDS` set to max int).

Acceptance Criteria
- Add token mint end timestamp to contract configuration.
- Enforce mint-end checks for artifact finding/minting in the contract (v0.6 parity).
- Wire client constants to the on-chain value (remove max-int fallback).
- Tests cover mint allowed before end and rejected after end.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New mint-related mechanics beyond v0.6.
