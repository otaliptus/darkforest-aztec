TASK 023 - Config hash validation against on-chain storage
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Prevent forged config usage by validating against stored hashes, not caller-provided hashes.

Background:
Private functions accept config and compare the computed hash against a caller-provided expected hash. This allows clients to forge config if the contract does not check against stored values.

Scope:
Contract change + client update.

Plan:
1) Read `config_hash_spacetype` and `config_hash_biome` from storage inside private functions.
2) Compute the config hash from inputs and compare to the stored hash.
3) Remove any reliance on caller-provided expected hash values.

Acceptance criteria:
- Forged config inputs are rejected.
- Stored config hashes are the single source of truth.

Risks / side-effects:
- Adds MiMC cost (expected). Performance optimizations should build on top of this, not bypass it.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Add a negative test with modified config; it must fail.
