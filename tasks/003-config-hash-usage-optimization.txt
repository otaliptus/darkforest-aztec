TASK 003 - Config hash usage optimization (performance-safe)

Mission:
Reduce redundant config hashing while preserving integrity.

Background:
The contract stores `config_hash_spacetype` and `config_hash_biome`. Private functions currently accept full config inputs, then compute hashes to compare with caller-provided expected hashes. This is safe but expensive.

Scope:
Contract and client changes. This task is performance-focused but must not weaken validation.

Plan:
1) Decide a safe pattern: either
   a) Load config values from storage inside private functions, OR
   b) Keep inputs but compare the computed hash against the stored on-chain hash (not a caller-provided hash).
2) Update private functions to avoid trusting caller-provided hashes.
3) Update client to pass only required inputs after the contract change.

Acceptance criteria:
- Private functions validate config against on-chain stored hash, not caller input.
- Hash computation occurs only when required for validation.
- No parity changes to config values or hashing scheme.

Risks / side-effects:
- Skipping hash computation without validating config values is unsafe. Do not do that.
- Changing private inputs can require client updates.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Add a test that attempts a move with a forged config and verify it fails.
- Benchmark proving time before/after.

Dependencies:
- Overlaps with Task 023 and Task 024. Decide the final approach before coding.
