TASK 017 - Noir loop early-exit review

Mission:
Confirm we already use the optimal loop pattern given Noir lacks `break`.

Background:
Noir loops always run full iterations. Guarded loops with `found` are the best available micro-optimization.

Scope:
Contract review only (possible minor refactor).

Plan:
1) Scan loops that check arrays of size 12 (arrivals, planets).
2) Ensure guard flags are used consistently to minimize work.
3) Add a comment or small refactor if any loop is missing the guard.

Acceptance criteria:
- All relevant loops use a guard flag for minimal work.
- No semantic changes.

Risks / side-effects:
- Tiny gains only; do not change logic for micro-optimizations.

Testing / benchmarks:
- None required beyond existing tests.
