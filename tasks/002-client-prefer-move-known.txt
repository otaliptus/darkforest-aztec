TASK 002 - Client prefers move_known for initialized destinations
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Reduce proof time on moves by routing known destinations through the cheaper `move_known` path.

Background:
`move` computes Perlin and performs location verification for the destination. `move_known` skips that when the destination is already initialized.

Scope:
Client-only change in `apps/client` (no contract changes required).

Plan:
1) Detect when a destination planet is already initialized in the local state (e.g., `planet.locationId != 0` and stored on chain).
2) If initialized, call `move_known` instead of `move`.
3) Keep a fallback to `move` if the destination is not fully known or local cache is stale.
4) Add a log or metric so we can verify that `move_known` is being used.

Acceptance criteria:
- Known destination moves call `move_known` and succeed without new Perlin proofs.
- Unknown destinations still use `move` and succeed.
- No new reverts introduced by stale client cache.

Risks / side-effects:
- If the client incorrectly treats a planet as initialized, `move_known` will revert. Add a fallback to `move` on failure.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Simulate a move to a known planet and verify `move_known` is used.
- Simulate a move to an unknown planet and verify `move` is used.
