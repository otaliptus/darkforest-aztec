TASK 049 - Devnet deployment runbook + hosting guidance
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Write a proper devnet deployment + hosting runbook (docs/devnet.md) aligned with current Aztec devnet docs
and our repo scripts, including gas sponsorship and player access options.

Scope:
- Docs only (devnet runbook + summary plan).

Plan:
1) Update docs/devnet.md with current devnet constants, deploy steps, gas sponsorship, and hosting guidance.
2) Update devnet-deployment-plan.md to match the new runbook and remove stale values.

Acceptance criteria:
- docs/devnet.md includes a step-by-step devnet deploy flow using deploy_devnet.js.
- docs/devnet.md clearly explains Sponsored FPC usage and fallback fee options.
- docs/devnet.md explains that ticker is local-only; devnet blocks advance automatically.
- docs/devnet.md includes hosting guidance + player access options (local dev vs hosted).
- devnet-deployment-plan.md does not contradict the runbook.
