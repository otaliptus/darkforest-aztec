Title: Implement planet transfer (v0.6 parity)

Context
- `transferPlanet` is missing in `packages/contracts/src/main.nr`.
- Client flag `PLANET_TRANSFER_ENABLED` is forced false in `apps/client/src/Backend/GameLogic/ContractsAPI.ts`.

Acceptance Criteria
- Implement `transferPlanet` with private validate -> public apply (only_self) flow in the Noir contract.
- Match v0.6 semantics (only initialized players, only owned planets, etc.).
- Add/extend any needed state in `packages/contracts/src/types.nr`.
- Client flag uses on-chain config and the transfer flow works end-to-end.
- Tests cover success and failure cases.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New transfer mechanics beyond v0.6.
- UI redesign beyond enabling existing transfer UI.
