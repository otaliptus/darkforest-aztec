Title: Create v0.6 feature gap checklist (Aztec port)

Context
- User request: “Make a checklist” based on the reported v0.6 features missing from the Aztec port.
- Goal is to document current gaps without changing gameplay logic.

Acceptance Criteria
- Add a checklist doc that enumerates the reported v0.6 features and marks their Aztec status.
- Each checklist item references the relevant Aztec contract/client files that confirm the status.
- Call out any partial/related behavior that could be mistaken for the missing feature (e.g., planet_pausers vs global pause).
- No gameplay logic changes; documentation only.

Out of Scope
- Implementing any of the missing features.
- Modifying contract/client behavior beyond documentation.

Notes
- Keep scope limited to the reported features and current repo evidence.
