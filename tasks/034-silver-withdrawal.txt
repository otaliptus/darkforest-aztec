Title: Implement silver withdrawal from spacetime rips (v0.6 parity)

Context
- `withdrawSilver` is missing in `packages/contracts/src/main.nr`.
- Client withdraw flow is blocked in `apps/client/src/Backend/GameLogic/GameManager.ts`.

Acceptance Criteria
- Implement `withdrawSilver` with private validate -> public apply (only_self) flow in the Noir contract.
- Match v0.6 semantics for trading posts (spacetime rips).
- Update client flow to enable withdraw when allowed; remove hardcoded error.
- Tests cover withdraw success and failure cases.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New silver mechanics beyond v0.6.
- UI redesign beyond enabling existing withdraw UI.
