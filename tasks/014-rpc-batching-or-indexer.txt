TASK 014 - RPC batching / indexer / caching layer

Mission:
Reduce latency and node load by aggregating read calls.

Background:
Client sync uses hundreds of parallel reads. Even with contract batch getters, a caching layer can further reduce repeated reads.

Scope:
Infrastructure change (optional). No contract changes required.

Plan:
1) Prototype an RPC batcher that coalesces read requests.
2) Optionally introduce a lightweight indexer cache for frequent reads.
3) Add feature flags in the client to enable/disable.

Acceptance criteria:
- Sync read count and latency improves measurably.
- Client still works when the batcher is disabled.

Risks / side-effects:
- Added infrastructure complexity; must be optional for decentralized usage.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Measure median sync time before/after with a test dataset.
