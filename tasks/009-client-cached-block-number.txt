TASK 009 - Client cached block number usage
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Reduce RPC chatter by reusing the tick's block number for arrival checks.

Background:
Per-arrival calls to `getCurrentBlockNumber()` cause RPC spam and latency spikes.

Scope:
Client-only change.

Plan:
1) Capture the block number once per tick.
2) Pass it down to arrival resolution logic instead of re-querying.
3) Remove redundant calls in resolve loops.

Acceptance criteria:
- Only one block number call per tick.
- Arrival scheduling uses the same block value across the tick.

Risks / side-effects:
- If block advances mid-tick, some arrivals resolve one tick later. This is acceptable.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Log the number of block-number RPC calls per tick and verify it is 1.
