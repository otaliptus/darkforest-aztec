TASK 012 - Client arrival state caching and lazy verification

Mission:
Avoid expensive `getArrivalState` queries unless needed.

Background:
The client often re-queries arrival state even when local state is consistent, adding RPC load.

Scope:
Client-only change.

Plan:
1) Trust local state for arrivals when possible.
2) Only call `getArrivalState` when a resolve tx fails, is delayed, or local state is stale.
3) Track a "last verified" timestamp per arrival.

Acceptance criteria:
- `getArrivalState` calls drop significantly in normal operation.
- Fallback verification still occurs on failure paths.

Risks / side-effects:
- If local state is wrong, arrivals may appear stale; ensure retry logic exists.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Simulate normal flow and verify fewer RPC calls.
- Simulate a failed resolve tx and verify verification is triggered.
