Title: Implement capture zones (v0.6 parity)

Context
- Capture zone mechanics are missing in the Aztec contract (`packages/contracts/src/main.nr`).
- Client has capture zone UI/config but `CAPTURE_ZONES_ENABLED` is forced false in `apps/client/src/Backend/GameLogic/ContractsAPI.ts`.

Acceptance Criteria
- Add capture zone config/constants and state to the Noir contract with v0.6 parity.
- Implement private validate -> public apply (only_self) flows for `invadePlanet` and `capturePlanet`.
- Implement capture zone generation algorithm (v0.6 blockhash randomness), using Aztec-safe randomness equivalent.
- Extend `Planet` state with capture-zone fields (invader, invadeStartBlock, capturer) as in v0.6.
- Wire contract constants to the client (no hardcoded `CAPTURE_ZONES_ENABLED: false`).
- Client capture-zone flow works end-to-end (UI enabled when config allows).
- Tests cover invade/capture flows and zone rotation.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New gameplay mechanics beyond v0.6 capture zones.
- UI redesign beyond enabling existing capture zone UI.

Notes
- Consider reusing `pseudo_blockhash` patterns already used for artifact discovery.
