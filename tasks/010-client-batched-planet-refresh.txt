TASK 010 - Client batched planet refresh

Mission:
Reduce UI refresh overhead by refreshing each planet at most once per tick.

Background:
Current logic calls `hardRefreshPlanet` per arrival, which multiplies reads and UI work.

Scope:
Client-only change.

Plan:
1) Collect a set of planet IDs that need refresh during a tick.
2) After processing arrivals, refresh each planet once.
3) If multiple arrivals hit the same planet, only one refresh occurs.

Acceptance criteria:
- `hardRefreshPlanet` is called once per planet per tick.
- UI still updates correctly after arrival resolution.

Risks / side-effects:
- Slightly delayed UI updates during the tick; should be unnoticeable.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Simulate 3 arrivals to one planet; verify a single refresh.
