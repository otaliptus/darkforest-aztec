TASK 015 - Foreground tick arrival resolver service

Mission:
Resolve matured arrivals even when players are idle.

Background:
Arrivals currently resolve only if a client submits `resolve_arrival`. A shared tick service can improve liveness.

Scope:
External service update (e.g., `aztec-tick.mjs`) and optional client hooks.

Plan:
1) Extend the tick service to scan for matured arrivals (via snapshots or an index).
2) Submit resolution txs on behalf of players or via a relayer model.
3) Ensure it is optional and does not violate decentralization expectations.

Acceptance criteria:
- Matured arrivals resolve even if no player client is active.
- Service can be disabled without breaking gameplay.

Risks / side-effects:
- Centralization and gas funding concerns. Document clearly.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Simulate idle clients and verify arrivals still resolve.
