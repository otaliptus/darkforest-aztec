TASK 055 - Cloudflare Pages build fix for workspace types
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Ensure the client build succeeds on Cloudflare Pages by building the
@darkforest_eth/types workspace before @darkforest_eth/hashing.

Scope:
- Client build scripts only.

Plan:
1) Update apps/client/package.json prebuild/predev/prestart to run types prepare first.

Acceptance criteria:
- Cloudflare build does not fail with "Cannot find module @darkforest_eth/types".
- Client build still runs hashing prepare after types prepare.
