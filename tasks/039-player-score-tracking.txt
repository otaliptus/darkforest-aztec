Title: Implement player score tracking (v0.6 parity)

Context
- `Player` lacks a `score` field in `packages/contracts/src/types.nr`.
- Reward claiming and capture zone scoring depend on player score.

Acceptance Criteria
- Add `score` to `Player` state with v0.6 parity.
- Implement score updates for the relevant gameplay actions (planet capture and capture zones as in v0.6).
- Wire client to display and use score from contract state.
- Tests cover score updates and edge cases.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New scoring rules beyond v0.6.

Notes
- Depends on capture-zone implementation (`tasks/031-capture-zones.txt`).
