Title: Implement missing admin functions (v0.6 parity)

Context
- v0.6 exposes admin-only functions (pause/unpause, world radius changes, owner setting, etc.).
- Aztec contract currently lacks these admin paths in `packages/contracts/src/main.nr`.

Acceptance Criteria
- Add admin-only functions required for v0.6 parity (safeSetOwner, changeWorldRadiusMin, adminSetWorldRadius, changeLocationRevealCooldown, withdraw, setPlanetTransferEnabled, addScore/deductScore, setTokenMintEndTime, etc.).
- Implement private validate -> public apply (only_self) flow with explicit admin access control.
- Wire client/admin tooling if present (or keep admin-only flows non-exposed in public UI).
- Tests cover admin-only access and state changes.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New admin features beyond v0.6.
- Non-admin gameplay changes.

Notes
- This may conflict with `tasks/025-remove-admin-actions.txt`. Resolve direction before implementation.
