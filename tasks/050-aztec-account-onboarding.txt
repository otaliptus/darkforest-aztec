TASK 050 - Aztec account onboarding in client
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Add an in-browser Aztec account create/import flow so hosted players can join
without setting env vars or local CLI accounts.

Scope:
- Client-only changes (GameLandingPage + config wiring).

Plan:
1) Add localStorage-backed Aztec account persistence (create/import).
2) Update Aztec onboarding flow to prompt for account choice in the terminal.
3) Connect Aztec only after account is selected/created.

Acceptance criteria:
- If no account keys are configured, the client prompts to create/import an Aztec account.
- Generated/imported keys persist in localStorage and are reused on reload.
- Aztec connection uses the selected account and proceeds to game load.
