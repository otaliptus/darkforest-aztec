TASK 006 - Earliest-arrival guard for resolve-by-ID
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Prevent out-of-order resolution when resolving by arrival ID.

Background:
Resolving a later arrival first can advance `last_updated` and permanently block earlier arrivals. This can create repeated resolve attempts and wasted proofs.

Scope:
Contract change only.

Plan:
1) In `resolve_arrival(id)`, find the earliest matured arrival for the destination planet.
2) Require that `id` matches the earliest matured arrival id before allowing resolution.
3) If not, revert with a clear error.

Acceptance criteria:
- Resolving a non-earliest matured arrival reverts.
- Resolving the earliest matured arrival succeeds and allows the next ones to proceed.

Risks / side-effects:
- Slight extra lookup cost (scan up to 12 arrivals).

Testing / benchmarks:
- Create two arrivals to the same planet. Attempt to resolve the later one first; verify revert.
- Resolve in order and verify success.
