Title: Add GPT Pro prompt bundling via LLM oracle repo pattern

Context
- Need a way to bundle repo code files into a single prompt-friendly file for GPT Pro.
- User requested referencing a GitHub "oracle" LLM repository that supports GPT Pro queries.

Acceptance Criteria
- Identify the relevant GitHub LLM "oracle" repository and document the relevant approach/tooling used for prompt packaging.
- Add or update a script/config in this repo to bundle selected code files into a single output file suitable for GPT Pro prompting.
- Provide a clear usage note in-repo for running the bundler.
- Keep changes scoped to tooling/docs; no contract logic changes.

Out of Scope
- Changing game logic or client behavior.
- Adding new dependencies unrelated to the bundling workflow.
