# Ticket 034 - Reference index + tree refresh

## Goal
Document reference repo index and update repository tree snapshot to reflect new layout.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Add a `reference/README.md` that lists the reference repos and notes they are not part of the build.
- Update `tree.txt` to reflect the current repo layout (with `reference/` in place).
- Ensure top-level docs do not mention old root-level reference paths.

## Out of Scope
- No changes to contract/client logic.

## Deliverables
- Updated `reference/README.md` and refreshed `tree.txt`.
