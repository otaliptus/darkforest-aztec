TASK 045 - Perlin single_scale_perlin divide hoist & p_unit reuse
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Reduce constraints in Perlin noise by hoisting repeated divisions and reusing scaled coordinates.

Background:
single_scale_perlin currently divides by scale multiple times inside a 0..4 loop
for each corner, including repeated scaled_p/scale and dist_vec/scale calculations.
These are constraint-heavy operations.

Scope:
Contract change only in packages/contracts/src/perlin.nr.

Plan:
1) Compute denom_over_scale = DENOMINATOR / scale once per call.
2) Hoist p_unit outside the loop using signed_mul_u128(p, denom_over_scale).
3) Replace corner_unit = scaled_corner / scale with corner_unit = coords[i] * denom_over_scale.
4) Replace dist_unit = dist_vec / scale with dist_unit = p_unit - corner_unit.

Acceptance criteria:
- single_scale_perlin returns the same results as before for identical inputs.
- Perlin-related tests continue to pass.
- No change to public contract interfaces.

Risks / side-effects:
- If scale is not a power-of-two divisor of DENOMINATOR, results could diverge.
- This should be safe given existing scale checks in multi_scale_perlin.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Run Noir contract tests (yarn contracts:test:nr).
