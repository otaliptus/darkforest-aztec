Title: Decide and implement debug facet (v0.6 parity)

Context
- v0.6 includes a DFDebugFacet for local testing helpers.
- Aztec contract has no debug helpers in `packages/contracts/src/main.nr`.

Acceptance Criteria
- Decide whether to port a minimal debug helper set (test-only) or explicitly document omission.
- If implemented, keep debug helpers gated (test-only / dev builds) and avoid exposing on production deployments.
- Tests updated to use debug helpers only where permitted.
- No unbounded loops in public contract functions.

Out of Scope
- New gameplay features.
- Debug helpers enabled in production.
