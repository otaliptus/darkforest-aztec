# Task 062: Rewrite README and grant proposal

## Goal
Rewrite README and grant_proposal.md to be clearer, more structured, and aligned with the current repo + RFP context, while emphasizing this repo was built solo in ~2 weeks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- README is rewritten with clear sections: project overview, quickstart (local + devnet), env vars, deployment (Cloudflare Pages), and repo structure.
- grant_proposal.md is rewritten into a polished, concise proposal with strong narrative and concrete milestones/budget.
- Both documents reflect the current repo state and recent deployment reality.
- Explicitly mention the project was built solo in ~2 weeks.
- No technical claims that are untrue for this repo.

## Notes
- Keep tone professional and confident; avoid filler.
- Use concrete dates where relevant (Jan 14, 2026 current context).
