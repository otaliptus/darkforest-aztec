TASK 011 - Client arrival scheduling with min-heap or per-planet queues

Mission:
Remove O(n log n) sorting per tick for arrival scheduling.

Background:
The client sorts all arrivals every tick to find the earliest. This scales poorly with many arrivals.

Scope:
Client-only change.

Plan:
1) Maintain a min-heap keyed by `arrivalTime`, or maintain a map of per-planet earliest arrival.
2) Update the heap when arrivals are added/removed or resolved.
3) Each tick, only examine the earliest arrival(s) rather than sorting all.

Acceptance criteria:
- No full-array sort per tick.
- Scheduling still resolves all matured arrivals.

Risks / side-effects:
- More complex state management; must handle stale or removed arrivals.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Add 1000 arrivals; verify tick time is stable and does not scale with sorting.
