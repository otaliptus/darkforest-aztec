TASK 020 - dist_max range parity decision

Mission:
Document and enforce the v0.6 behavior that allows delayed arrivals when `dist_max > actual_distance`.

Background:
The v0.6 rules allow `dist_max` to exceed actual distance to intentionally delay arrival. Enforcing `dist_max <= range` would break parity.

Scope:
Contract tests + client documentation. No functional clamp should be added.

Plan:
1) Add a test that validates `actual_distance <= dist_max` is sufficient for a valid move.
2) Ensure no new logic clamps `dist_max` to `range` unless explicitly approved.
3) Document this parity requirement in a non-.md note or code comment.

Acceptance criteria:
- Tests confirm delayed-arrival strategy works.
- No `dist_max <= range` enforcement is added without a dedicated decision.

Risks / side-effects:
- None; this protects parity.

Testing / benchmarks:
- Add a test that submits a move with `dist_max > actual_distance` and verifies success.
