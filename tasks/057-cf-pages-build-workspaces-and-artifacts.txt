TASK 057 - Cloudflare Pages build: prepare df workspaces + ship DarkForest artifact
Status: Done (2026-01-14)

Mission:
Fix Cloudflare Pages build failures for missing @darkforest_eth/* modules and the
DarkForest contract artifact by preparing required workspaces and bundling a
tracked artifact for the client build.

Scope:
- apps/client/package.json
- apps/client/src/Backend/Aztec/scripts/darkforest.ts
- packages/contracts/ (add tracked DarkForest artifact)
- packages/df-renderer/src/Renderer.ts
- packages/df-network/src/EthConnection.ts
- packages/df-network/src/Network.ts
- packages/df-hashing/src/mimc.ts
- packages/df-hashing/src/index.ts

Plan:
1) Add a client prebuild helper to prepare all @darkforest_eth workspace deps in order.
2) Add a tracked DarkForest contract artifact outside ignored target/.
3) Update client import to use the tracked artifact path.

Acceptance criteria:
- Cloudflare Pages build no longer fails with missing @darkforest_eth/* modules.
- Client build no longer fails on missing darkforest_contract-DarkForest.json.
- Client still builds locally with the same entrypoint.
