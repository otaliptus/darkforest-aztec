# Progress Report (2026-01-03 16:53 local)

## Current State
- Client connects to local Aztec node, registers DarkForest + NFT, and reads on-chain GameConfig.
- Private proving enabled in client; init_player and reveal_location now succeed and confirm on-chain.
- Vite dependency mismatch fixed by prebundling bb-prover so VK lookup uses the same stdlib instance.

## Recent Wins
- Init player and reveal locations confirmed end-to-end with real proofs:
  - init_player: prove ~54s, confirmation ~6s (total ~60s).
  - reveal_location: prove ~50s, confirmation ~15s (total ~65s).
- VK error resolved (no more "VK index ... not found in VK tree").

## Current Local Addresses
- DarkForest: 0x215e4042aafbcd3da9e113ebfded8569271af947cd0c9559ec3e878eab8d795b
- NFT: 0x097ef8cee600df0e1c3f765449df7b12b57976e97861cd5dde0a60aa43f3ca75

## Strengths
- Typed storage readers + config hashing wired; client tracks perlin config from chain.
- Core UX is already in place for all main actions (init, reveal, move, upgrade, prospect, find, trade, activate).
- Now proving on the client works reliably; the hard VK tree issue is solved.

## Weak Spots / Risks
- Only init + reveal are verified with real proofs; other flows are still untested end-to-end.
- Turn time is close to the 60s target even for simple actions; performance target may be tight.
- No documented performance measurements yet (needed for ticket 020).
- Local dev relies on correct Vite dep graph; a bad optimize cache can reintroduce VK issues.
- NFT / artifact flows still need validation (minting + ownership reads).

## What Is Left for Ticket 019
- Validate move/capture, upgrade, prospect, find, trade (deposit/withdraw), activate/deactivate.
- Confirm galaxy view and resource panels update correctly after each action.
- Confirm NFT ownership reflects artifact deposits/withdrawals.
- If any flow fails, fix client wiring or contract interaction edge cases.

## Next Ticket Preview (020)
- Measure proof + send + confirm timings for each action type.
- Identify optimizations if any action exceeds 60s.
- Devnet deployment scripts + docs and troubleshooting.
